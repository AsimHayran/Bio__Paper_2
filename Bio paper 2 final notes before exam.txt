 1.Nitrogen Cycle
    1.Nitrogen Fixation
       Nitrogen gas (N₂) from the air is converted into ammonia (NH₃) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria
    2.Nitrification
        Ammonia (NH₃) is converted into nitrites (NO₂⁻) and then nitrates (NO₃⁻) by nitrifying bacteria
    3.Assimilation
        Plants take in nitrates (NO₃⁻) from the soil and use them to make proteins and DNA.
    4.Ammonification
        When plants and animals die (or produce waste), decomposers  break them down into ammonia (NH₃).
    5.Denitrification
        Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates (NO₃⁻) back into nitrogen gas (N₂), which returns to the air.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.carbon cycle
   1. Photosynthesis
        Co2+Ho2-->Glucose+O2 
   2. Respiration
        Glucose+O2-->Co2+Ho2+Energy
   3. Feeding (Consumption)
         Animals eat plants, passing carbon through the food chain.
   4. Decomposition
         When organisms die, decomposers break them down, releasing CO₂ or forming fossil fuels over millions of years.
   5. Combustion (Burning)
         When fossil fuels or wood are burned, CO₂ is released into the air.
   6. Fossilisation & Sedimentation
          Dead organisms get buried and compressed over millions of years, forming fossil fuels

 2.Mentrual cycle
     1. FSH
         It mature the egg
     2. LH
         Releases the egg
     3. Osrogen
          Builds-up the lining of the uterus
     3. Progesieren 
           maintains the lining thickneses
  Menstrual cycle  (28 days)
     Stage1(dey 1)-> pitucitary gland releases FSh--> auses ovaries to make oestrogen
     Stage2(day 4)-> oestrogen-thickens the uterus lining and stops the pituitary gland
     Stage3(day 14)-> pituetry gland releases LH-LH releses eggs and ovanes release progesterone
     stage4(day 28)->progesterone-- keeps uterus lining thick and stops the piuitary gland from releasing FSH and LH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Controlling fertility
     managing the ability to get pregnant. Either by increasing the chances of pregnancy or by preventing pregnancy.
1. IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation)
 What is it: A fertility treatment where egg and sperm are combined outside the body in a lab.
Process:
    1. Woman is given hormones to stimulate multiple eggs.
    2. Eggs are collected from ovaries.
    3. Eggs are fertilised by sperm in the lab.
    4. Fertilised embryos grow for a few days.
    5. One or more embryos are implanted back into the woman’s uterus to develop naturally.
        Purpose: Helps couples who have problems with fertility (e.g., blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count).
        Pros: Can enable pregnancy when natural conception is difficult.
        Cons: Expensive, not always successful, emotionally and physically demanding.

2. Clomifene Therapy
what it is : A fertility drug that stimulates the pituitary gland to release more FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone).
How it works: Increased FSH causes ovaries to mature and release eggs (induces ovulation).
Purpose: Used for women who do not ovulate regularly or have low hormone levels affecting fertility.
Pros: Non-invasive, can improve chances of natural conception.
Cons: Possible side effects: hot flushes, headaches, multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets).

1. Blood Vessels
     1. Arteries
           Blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body under pressure
           Structure:- Thick, muscular, and elastic walls to handle high pressure from the heart pumping.
                     - Narrow lumen (the inside space) to maintain pressure.
                     - No valves (because blood is pumped strongly enough).
           Function:  Deliver oxygen-rich blood and nutrients quickly to body tissues.
            Blood pressure:	High pressure due to forceful heart contractions.
          
     2. Capillaries
           The smallest blood vessels in the body connecting arterioles and venules.
            Structure: - One cell thick walls (very thin) to allow easy exchange.
                       - Narrow lumen, just wide enough for red blood cells to pass through single-file.
           Function: Allow exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste between blood and body cells 
           
     3. Venis
          Blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart
            Structure:	- Thinner walls than arteries.
                        - Larger lumen to help blood flow at low pressure.
                        - Valves present to prevent backflow of blood.
            Function: Return blood to the heart for re-oxygenation and removal of waste.
            Blood pressure: Low pressure compared to arteries.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Heart 
The heart is divided into four chambers:
    1. Right Atrium – Receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the vena cava.
    2. Right Ventricle – Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.
    3. Left Atrium – Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins.
    4. Left Ventricle – Pumps oxygenated blood to the body via the aorta (has the thickest muscle wall for high-pressure pumping).

Key Functions of the Heart
             Double Pump System
             Right side pumps blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) for oxygenation.
             Left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body (systemic circulation).
             Valves (tricuspid, bicuspid, pulmonary, aortic) prevent backflow of blood.
             Coronary Arteries supply the heart muscle itself with oxygenated blood.
 Steps
   Step 1: Deoxygenated Blood Enters the Heart
             Deoxygenated blood from the body flows into the right atrium through the vena cava.
    Step 2: Blood Moves to the Right Ventricle
              The right atrium contracts, pushing blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.
    Step 3: Blood is Pumped to the Lungs
              The right ventricle contracts, forcing blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery 
              The blood travels to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
    Step 4: Oxygenated Blood Returns to the Heart
             Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins 
    Step 5: Blood Moves to the Left Ventricle
            The left atrium contracts, pushing blood through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle.
    Step 6: Blood is Pumped to the Body
        The left ventricle contracts strongly, forcing blood through the aortic valve into the aorta.
        The oxygen-rich blood is then distributed to the entire body through smaller arteries and capillaries
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Blood
    Blood is made up of four main components:

Component	
Plasma (55%)	A yellow liquid that carries:
     Function
       - Nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids)
       - Waste products (e.g., CO₂, urea)
       - Hormones
       - Proteins (e.g., antibodies, clotting factors)
Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)	- Contain haemoglobin to carry oxygen
   Function
     - No nucleus (more space for haemoglobin)
     - Biconcave shape (large surface area for gas exchange)
White Blood Cells (Leucocytes)	- Part of the immune system
  Function
   - Fight infections (some produce antibodies, others engulf pathogens via phagocytosis)
   - Have a nucleus
Platelets	- Tiny cell fragments
  Function
- Help clot blood (prevent excessive bleeding)

Functions of Blood
 1. Transport
      Oxygen (from lungs to cells via red blood cells)
      Carbon dioxide (from cells to lungs to be exhaled)
      Nutrients (e.g., glucose from digestion to cells)
      Waste (e.g., urea to kidneys for excretion)
      Hormones (chemical messengers, e.g., insulin)
  2. Defence 
      White blood cells destroy pathogens (bacteria, viruses).
      Antibodies help fight infections.
  3.Temperature Regulation
      Blood absorbs and distributes heat to maintain body temperature.
      Clotting (Prevents Blood Loss)
      Platelets form clots to seal wounds.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================plant structures=============================================================
1. Stomata
     Tiny pores found mostly on the underside of plant leaves.
      Structure: - Each stoma (singular) is surrounded by guard cells that control its opening and closing.
                 - Guard cells change shape to open or close the pore.
 Function: 
     - Allow gas exchange between the plant and the atmosphere.
     - Let carbon dioxide (CO₂) in for photosynthesis.
     - Let oxygen (O₂) out as a byproduct of photosynthesis.
     - Enable water vapor to exit during transpiration.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Transpiration
      The process by which water vapor is lost from a plant. Water moves from high concentration to low concentration.
   Factors affecting transpiration:	
     1. Light intensity (more light → more transpiration), 
     2. temperature (higher temp → faster transpiration), 
     3. humidity (lower humidity → more transpiration), wind (more wind → more transpiration).
  How it happens:	
      1. Water is absorbed by roots from the soil.
      2. Water travels up the plant through xylem vessels.
      3. Water evaporates from the leaf surfaces inside the leaf.
      4. Water vapor exits the leaf through open stomata into the air.

2. Translocation
         The transport of menrals from  leaves to other parts of the plant using active transport
     Why it happens: Transpiration creates a water potential gradient that pulls water up from the roots, helping transport nutrients and keeping cells turgid.
Factors affecting transpiration:	Light intensity (more light → more transpiration), temperature (higher temp → faster transpiration), humidity (lower humidity → more transpiration), wind (more wind → more transpiration).
Active Transport
     movement of substances from a low concentration to a high concentration, against the concentration gradient, using energy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. xylem and phlome 
     1. Xylem
         Function:
              1. Transports water and dissolved minerals (e.g., nitrates) from roots to leaves (upwards only).
              2. Provides structural support (contains lignin, making plant stems rigid).
        Key Features:
              1. Dead cells (hollow tubes with no cytoplasm).
              2. Lignin (a tough, waterproof substance) that strengthens the walls.
              3. Transpiration stream (water movement driven by evaporation from leaves).
         Process:
            Roots absorb water and minerals from soil.
            Water moves up xylem vessels by transpiration pull (evaporation from leaves creates suction).
            Cohesion-tension theory – Water molecules stick together (cohesion) and are pulled upwards.

     2. Phloem
         Function:
            1. Transports menrals to growing and storage tissues (up and down the plant).This process is called translocation.
        Key Features:
           1. Living cells (unlike xylem).
           2. Made of sieve tube elements (no nucleus, allows sap flow) and companion cells (provide energy for translocation).
           3. Requires energy (ATP) for active transport.
        Process:
          1. Sugars are made in source
          2. Sugars are actively loaded into phloem.
          3. Water follows by osmosis, creating pressure that pushes sap to sink (e.g., roots, fruits).
